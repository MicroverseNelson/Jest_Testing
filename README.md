This application we are using jest as a testing tool to ensure and emphasize code performance
- Use Jest library is used to write a few practical tests for JavaScript functions
 
 # Delopyment
fir this version of testing we will be currently working on command line only

 # Built With
- Languages -  Javascript
- Frameworks - [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) JavaScript Testing Framework
- Technologies - Web Technology
